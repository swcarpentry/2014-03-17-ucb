      "In this lecture we've only covered a couple of the ways that you can read/write data.  While textfiles and CSV files are a common way of storing values, there many, many others.  Fortunately, Python has libraries for handling most of them.  Some things worth looking into are [JSON](http://www.json.org/), [HDF](http://www.hdfgroup.org/), [pickle](http://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html), and [savez](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.savez.html).\n",
      "\n",
      "As a general note, Pandas should have the ability to read/write to most of these types of storage.  One special case is when you use a proprietary storage format (e.g., if you've bought a machine that stores data in a company-specific way).  \n",
      "\n",
      "There are also many high-level file handlers in `numpy`, such as `loadtxt` and `savetxt`, that are also useful and we encourage you to look into them.  Finally, a totally different kind of data reading problem involves pulling data the internet.  For this, there are dedicated libraries for parsing websites and pulling information from them.  Rest-assured, these tools exist, but this challenge is beyond the scope of this lecture.  "
