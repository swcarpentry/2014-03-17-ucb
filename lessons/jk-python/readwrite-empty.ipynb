      "\n",
      "There are several packages for dealing with structured data in a more intelligent way (e.g., see [matplotlib.mlab](http://matplotlib.org/api/mlab_api.html) and [recarrays](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.recarray.html).  However, in recent years, [Pandas]( http://pandas.pydata.org/) has risen above the rest in its usability and flexibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pandas is one of the most powerful tools for doing data analysis in python.  It provides a way of representing, reading/writing, manipulating, analyzing, and plotting your data (among others). It has a fairly steep learning curve, but we assure you it will be worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main data structure in Pandas is known as the \"DataFrame\" (which is quite similar to a Dataframe in R, if you're into that kind of thing...).  It let's you conveniently and clearly store, manipulate, plot, store, filter, etc, all kinds of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we can create dataframes manually, here we will use Pandas I/O functionality, which can easily read from csv files (and from many others as well, such as JSON, HTML, or HDF)\n",
      "\n",
      ">Note - Pandas can do *a lot*, and it's a very complicated package to understand in full.  For this tutorial, we will stick with reading in data, looking at it, and writing it     back to a file.  If you want to do more with pandas, check out the [extensive documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) online (though be prepared for a relatively steep learning curve)"

Some things worth looking into are [JSON](http://www.json.org/), [HDF](http://www.hdfgroup.org/), [pickle](http://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html), and [savez](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.savez.html).\n",
