COPY THESE INTO A FILE MEAN_SIGHTINGS.PY

--------------------------

NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT A REALISTIC WORKFLOW USING NOTEBOOK AND FILES

Let's say we want to build a module to count number of animals

!cat sightings_tab_sm.csv

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

WRITE SOME PSEUDOCODE TO DESCRIBE WHAT WE WANT TO DO

# Goal: Get number of records and mean sightings per record

# Choose focusanimal

focusanimal = 'Owl'

# Load table

table = pd.read_csv('sightings_tab_sm.csv')

# Get subtable with only that animal

isfocus = table['Animal'] == focusanimal
subtable = table[isfocus]

# Count number of records

n_records = len(subtable)

# Calculate mean sightings per record

mean_sightings = np.mean(subtable['Count'])

# Print number and mean

print n_records, mean_sightings

NOW WE HAVE A SCRIPT, LET'S MAKE IT A REUSABLE FUNCTION

def get_sightings(filename, focusanimal):
"""
Get number of records and mean sightings per record
"""

	# Choose focusanimal
	focusanimal = 'Owl'

	# Load table
	table = pd.read_csv('sightings_tab_sm.csv')

	# Get subtable with only that animal
	isfocus = table['Animal'] == focusanimal
	subtable = table[isfocus]

	# Count number of records
	n_records = len(subtable)

	# Calculate mean sightings per record
	mean_sightings = np.mean(subtable['Count'])

	# Print number and mean
	return n_records, mean_sightings

NOW PUT THIS FUNCTION IN SIGHTINGS MODULE, IMPORT IT, AND RUN IT

from mean_sightings import get_sightings
print get_sightings('sightings_tab_sm.csv', 'Owl')
