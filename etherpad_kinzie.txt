Anna's Shell lesson: http://swcarpentry.github.io/2014-03-17-ucb/lessons/as-shell/tutorial.html

*Note for Anna to change the ll alias to ls -h for people who don't have that alias
*For Regular Expressions--make a note about adjusting whitespace according to the file
*One note I have is to explain the piping in regards to the example a little more just for context purpose
* Want to use awk with plots? Check out gnuplot, a command-line plotting program
* "cat pdb_codes.txt | while read line; do ./get_atoms_in_protein.sh $line; done" is equivalent to "while read line; do ./get_atoms_in_protein.sh $line; done < pdb_codes.txt"
Nice, thanks Anna!

git clone https://github.com/swcarpentry/2014-03-17-ucb.git gird [1]

FYI - while the above did not work on my mac, changing https to git works.

git checkout gh-pages
cd lessons/md-ipythonblocks/
ipython notebook

If the "git clone" command doesn't work for you, click "Download ZIP" in the lower right-hand corner of https://github.com/swcarpentry/2014-03-17-ucb/tree/gh-pages
Unzip the zip file to create a 2014-03-17-ucb-gh-pages directory
mv that directory somewhere nice
continue from the "cd" line

columns = ['person', 'country', 'variable1', 'variable2']
observations = [
    ['john', 'USA', 12, 50],

    ['jimmy', 'Canada', 123, 4],
    ['lisa', 'USA', np.nan, 5],
    ['jill', 'Canada', 13, np.nan]
]
*casting part was confusing


A lil extra feedback- posting the ipython notebooks in the future could be helpful so that people are able to catch up in the lecture if they have (in my case install drama) issues that cause hang-ups. :)


I agree - Please post the notebooks

Note that many notebooks are available in the 'lessons' directory

http://swcarpentry.github.io/2014-03-17-ucb/lessons/

imports for the vis:
%matplotlib inline

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('oak_weather_2013.csv')
df2 = df.set_index(df['PST'], drop=False)

Also, can the color of the '(' and '[' be changed on the display.  I can't see the light blue and keep missing them and getting syntax errors

http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/9610711

In commands like "nano description &" the ampersand means that the command should run in the background and let you use keep using your terminal. This may not work on MinGW.

For those (at least on the mac) who don't have py.test, you can run
pip install -U pytest
from the command line. May need to run with sudo (sudo pip install -U pytest)




Thank you.  The testing segment was great!

dependencies:

http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html

put your Python-specific dependencies in a file called requirements.txt
eg:

numpy==1.8.0
ipython>=0.13

then run on the command line:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Good
Well prepared+1
+ I really liked the Reproducible_workflow section and the testing and modules section. Mat knows his stuff. Unfortunately, most of us are not at that stage of python software development yet. But I guess it instills good habits.
Great job with the testing and reproducibility sections!+1

Very well structured with all aspects of a reproducible workflow covered in at least some detail +1
I thought Anna, Mat and Dav were very good instructors. I thought the two day course format was very effective, getting us up and running from basics was very effective.I was really most interested in GitHub and this helped me think through how to incorporate it as a tool in my workflows.
Live demos (python/ipython, git, testing, etc.) that we could try out in real time.+1
+ Matt Davis is a great teacher,  His sections were very +1+1
clear and the documentation was easy to follow.
All the instructors were friendly and helpful and had a great attitude.+1+1

First half of 1st day and last half of 2nd day were great! Very easy to follow
Good pacing in general, though shell/intro might have gone faster to leave more time for demos +1
Wish I have learned the reproducible workflow earlier+1
Great organization of content+1

Bad
some times too fast
Tutorial documentation not always available prior to the tutorial
Git section was a bit confusing - more graphic would help
More Python!
The notebooks should all be releases prior to the segment,
More detailed notes for those of us who had to step in & out (and so missed content)
The Monday afternoon session on ipython and matrix operations was a bit rushed and harder to follow, although I still got something out of it.  +1
Git section was not very intuitive. I expected there to be more python instruction in this bootcamp. I really didn't learn much new stuff regarding making python scripts and programs.
A section on using a data storage service coupled with github would be nice+1
In the Monday sessions, if I fell behind, it was hard to catch up (couldn't see the commands previously entered by the instructor in the iPython notebooks)
The demonstration with notebook would be better with better pace - with inline output, it's hard to see the original code after you run it (wonder if there is a full screen mode)
Maybe get a room with multiple projectors/screens?
Need more time to understand Git/GitHub
commuting form palo alto
last half of 1st day on pandas and numpy was too fast. And notes would help - please provide online. Thanks! +2
On the 1st day it would be useful to have some discussion of what the advantages of python are over some other programming languages.
Needed a few more power strips in Kinzie Room - many seats were not near one.
Windows not as well supported as Mac/Linux

Other
Thanks for your patients 
You were all great. Thanks so much.+1000 +1+1
parallel computing with python?
I would like another class on scientific computing with python to go into more depth+1
+1 I know ipython is your favorite but it was more like R (when combined with pandas and numpy), which was not what I was expecting from this workshop. Maybe a more advanced python class with some OOP and develeoping softwares/modules would be good. But overall this was great.thanks!!+1
Thanks so much. This was a great experience for me and I will definitely look to attend another SWC event.
谢谢
Amazing that instructors are volunteering for this!
